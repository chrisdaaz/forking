- handful of baby spinach
- 0.25 cups cheddar cheese
- 1 flour tortilla

directions:
- Heat a medium skillet over medium heat.
- While skillet heats, crack two eggs into a bowl, add a pinch of salt to taste and beat with fork or implement of choice until well mixed.
- Add 1 tsp of butter or olive oil to the pan and add beans until heated.  Add spinach and saute until wilted, stirring occasionally. 
- Add the eggs in a layer over the spinach and beans, scrambling and cooking to desired doneness.
- Remove egg, bean and spinach mixture from skillet into a dish.
- To the same skillet, add the tortilla.  Cook for a few minute on one side, then flip.
