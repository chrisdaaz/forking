image: breakfast-porridge.jpg

ingredients:
- Rolled Oats (as much or as little as you like)
- Cacao powder (to taste)
- Liquid (your choice of milk such as: oat, cows, almond, water or whatever you like)
- Cinnamon
- Nuts (I use walnuts, almounds, pecans but you can use whatever you like)
- Fruit, fresh or frozen (I go for apricots, fig, frozen blueberries, strawberries and blackberries)

directions:
- Measure out how much oats you want
- Add the cacao poweder and cinnamon to the oats and mix together (this stop the cacao powder lumping together when you add the liquid)
- Add liquid to the mix so that the oats are covered and can move around a bit (how much depends on how thick you like your oats. It also may take a few attempts of trial and error to work out your preference)
- Stir the mixutre
- (To make overnight oats, at this point, you can decant the mixture into an airtight container, close, and shake. Store overnight in the fridge and eat in the morning. Add any topping you like in the morning)
- Put the mixture in a microwave and heat on full power for approximatly 3 minutes 30 seconds. Take out, stir and put back in the microwave. Heat until mixture is of the consistency that you require
- Remove from microwave (Bowl will be hot)
- Add frozen fruit as this point
- Cut up fruit and nuts and stir into mixture
